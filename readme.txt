hmark - for creating hashed bookmarks (still working on it)

  example usage:

    hmark set -k "bookmark_key" -u "https://..."

    bookmarks you create will be stored in the ~/.hmark/bookmarks folder, where
    tilde, is of course, your home directory.

  example bookmarks folder:

    * ~/.hmark/bookmarks/
